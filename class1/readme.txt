ECMAScript stands for European Computer Manufacturer Association Script
It lays out the specification and basic rules of language on which javascript is based on

ES6 / ECMAScript 2015 was the second major relaese for javascript

- let
- const
- deafult parameetrs
- reset parameters
- spread operator
- destructing
- for..of loop
- template literal
- modules
- map()
- arrow function

# let
the let keyword is similar to the var keyword except that these variable are blocked-scope


# Const
a new keyword of declaring a constant by using the const keyword. 
the const keyword create a read-only reference value
variable declared by the const keyword can't be reassigned

# default parameetrs

# Reset parameters
Es6 provides a new kind of parameters called rest parameetrs that has a prefix of three dots (...)
a rest parameters allows you to refresent an indefinite number of arguments as an array
the last parameters is prefixed with three dots

# Spread operator
Es6 provides a new opeartor called spread opeartor that consit of three dots (...)
the spread opeartor allows you to spread out elements of an iterable object such as an array, map or set

# destructing
Es6 provide a new feature called destructuring assignment that allows you to destructure
properties of an object or elemtns of an array into individual variables

# for..of loop

# template literal
Prior to ES6 we use single or double quote to wrap string
backtick(`)

multiline string
string formatting
html escaping

# Arrow function
Es6 arrao function provide yuou with an alternative way to write a shorter syntex compare to
function expression

# map function
the map() method create a new array with the result of calling a function for every array element
the map() method calls the provided function once for each element in an array in order

# Class

DRY- dont repeat yourself

# modules
ES6 module is a javascript file that executes in strict mode only
it means that any variable or functiuon declared in the module wont be added automatically to the global scope
