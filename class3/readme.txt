# Components
- A component represent a part of user interface
- Whatever is visible on the web page ia a component, we can combine together these component to make a 
  bigger component which can also be called as web page
- components are reusable and make the application more module
- eg header, slodebar, footer, content and all are indivual and independent components which we can kept 
  inside a root component

# Type of Component
1. Class Component
2. Functional Component

# Function Component vs Class Component
Functional Component
- are also known as Stateless component
- they work like a JavaScript function which accept props as an argument
- they do not have theor own state
- they return valid JSX / react element

Class Component
- are also known as statefull component
- are more complex component and conceptually behaves as classes introduce in ES6
- manage their own state


# Install Bootstrap
> npm install <package_name>
> npm i <package_name>
> npm i <pacjage_name>@<version>

> npm i bootstrap@4.6

black - dark
white - light
red - danger
green - success
yellow - warning
blue - primary


# JSX
JSX = JavaScript + XML
extension to the javascript language syntex
write xml like code for elements and components
JSX isnot necessary to write in react app this is for out convienece
JSX can be considered as synatactical expression of javascript syntex, used to create react element

# Why JSX?
- faster then javascript in compilation and execution
- ensures optimization during transalation of the code to JS
- ensures better optimization as it allows React to highlight usefull error and message of warning at compile time
- Using JSX developers find easier to work with components of react having UI insdie the JS code


- class - className
- for - htmlFor


# Props - to send data between the component
# State - to main data with in a component

Props -> properties


# Props vs State
1. props get passed to the components where as state is managed with in component
2. props are immutable where as state can be changed
3. in functioal component we pass as function parameters where as we declare variable with a function body as state
